## `TSDX` 📦

⬆️ [Bach to top](#table-of-contents-)

- is meant for libraries (we are not creating an app!)
- we are using `tsdx` to quickly create a TypeScript project
- choosing `react-with-storybook` as a template
- creates a project with the following structure:

```txt
/example
  index.html
  index.tsx       # test your component here in a demo app
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
/src
  index.tsx       # EDIT THIS
/test
  blah.test.tsx   # EDIT THIS
/stories
  Thing.stories.tsx # EDIT THIS
/.storybook
  main.js
  preview.js
.gitignore
package.json
README.md         # EDIT THIS
tsconfig.json
```
